PolarStore is the app store for PolarOS, it's built off Node.js. The app uses Electron to load the webpage the web app is hosted on.

As for the app itself, I will not be documenting it as part of my own personal time. If you see any problems with it, please report them in the issues tab of the GitHub. Be informative and use common sense when reporting issues.
